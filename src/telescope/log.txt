Changed delimiters in the UTC date field to "-" for ISO-8601
compliance.

Loosened up checking for delimiters when parsing the UTC
field to accept any delimiter between date and time fields.
A space is still required between the date and time.

Loosened up parsing of latitude and longitude for the observing
site to accept a space as a delimiter between degrees and
minutes.

2003 April 8

Loosened up parsing of right ascension fields in the telescope
aim point to permit any delimiter after the hours field.

Changed the "install" target to "mv" both executables into the
new /vitesse/server/cgi-executables directory.  The icons are
no longer installed automatically by "make install".

If CACHE_WARNING is defined, a big HTML comment screed is now
included before the "<img src="> tag which includes the cached
image in the HTML result document warning users who look at the
source to figure out where the image is coming from not to link
to it in the cache directory.

The code which enforces the CPU time limit (to bail us out of
loops caused by bad handling of malformed requests) fell afoul
of the Protean signal handling in Solaris.  I changed the "signal"
call to "sigset" and it seems to work now.  I also changed the
time limit exceeded message to display in a red font.

Added a "-" option specification which marks the end of the
list of options identified by a leading "-" and changed the
order of arguments supplied by the cgi-bin/Yourtel and
cgi-bin/Yourhorizon scripts to supply a "-" before the
numeric arguments to block attempts to spoof options.

Commented out the fclose() of the output file in gifout.c.
This was leading to a double close when vplanet.c closed
the non-stdout output file.

Rewrote TH() in vplanet.c to eliminate the modification
of constant strings, which the GCC priesthood has deemed
sinful.

Added a definition of __USE_XOPEN_EXTENDED before the inclusion
of <signal.h> in vplanet.c to avoid a warning from GCC.

Cleaned up numerous GCC -Wall natters.  Braces were added to some
logic in project.c to avoid so-called "ambiguous if-else" constructions.
If something breaks in odd projections, compare this closely with
the original.

Terrain generation in horizon (-y option) mode was failing because
of an assumption embedded in the initgauss() function of terrain.c
that the maximum value returned by rand() obeyed the POSIX
semantics, which is not the case with the GCC library.  I replaced
the hard-coded limit with a reference to RAND_MAX, which should
yield the correct value on all platforms.

Fixed an off by 12 hours in the "-e2" option converting
a specified Julian day to civil date.

2005 June 27

Added code to vplanet.c to constrain the telescope field of view to
a maximum of 90 degrees (a full hemisphere).  Setting the field of
view greater not only requires "eyes in the back of your head",
yielding ridiculous plots, but can run into problems in project.c,
where runaway recursion in drawcurveline() causes the plot to take
almost forever and contain bizarre lines off the edge.  If the user
sets the field of view to a value greater than 90 degrees, not
only will it be limited in the plot but also in the field in the
control panel in the result document.

2005 July 3

Fixed a potential buffer overflow in importing orbital elements
passed into an image generation by a di= argument.

2006 January 8

It was possible to hang yourtel and yourizon by specifying a UTC or
Julian date extremely far in the future, which caused the call on
kepler in sunpos to loop.  As this call is done at the end of option
processing, before time limit enforcement began, this would
permanently generate a CPU loop on the server.  I moved the time limit
enforcement to start at the very top of main() in vplanet.c, even
before option processing begins to prevent such disasters in the
future, and restored the future date sanity checks for UTC and Julian
"-e" option epoch specifications which were removed in a fit of
idealism some time ago.  Any specification of a date greater than
8000-01-01 will now be reset to an epoch of "Now".
