<cite>Your Sky</cite> can display the sky as it appeared at any date and time from
4713 <span class="sc">B.C.</span> to the distant future (the Sun, Moon, and planets are not
shown for dates beyond <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 8000 because the technique used to
calculate their positions is not valid beyond that date).  This
permits you to create a star map for almost any date in recorded
history.  Did the attackers take advantage of a new Moon to
sneak up on the enemy?  Plug in the date and location of the
battle and see for yourself!

<h3>The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere</h3>

<p>
The ability to display the sky at any moment in
history lets you quickly answer questions such as that posed in the
April 1992 issue of <a href="http://www.skytonight.com/" target="_blank">Sky &amp;
Telescope</a> magazine (page 437): did Paul Revere's midnight ride
really occur under the full Moon, or did Longfellow add the Moon to
his poem purely for atmosphere?  Press
<a href="/cgi-bin/Yoursky?date=1&amp;utc=1775%2F4%2F19+05%3A00%3A00&amp;jd=2450851.02963&amp;lat=42%B021%2724&amp;ns=North&amp;lon=42%B021%2724&amp;ew=West&amp;coords=on&amp;moonp=on&amp;deepm=2.5&amp;consto=on&amp;constn=on&amp;limag=5.5&amp;starn=on&amp;starnm=2.0&amp;starb=on&amp;starbm=2.5&amp;imgsize=640&amp;scheme=0&amp;elements="><b>Update</b></a>
to enter the time and date of Revere's ride: 05:00:00 UTC April 19th,
1775, and set the observing site to Boston.  The resulting map shows that
the Moon was indeed close to full that night, confirming Revere's own
recollection that &ldquo;the Moon shone bright&rdquo;.  Further, the position of
the Moon icon confirms the Moon was ascending in the southeastern sky
as seen from Boston as Revere began his ride.

<h3>The Star of Bethlehem</h3>

<p>
Some historians have speculated that the
<a href="/etexts/www/Bible/Matthew.html#2">Star of Bethlehem</a>
mentioned in the New Testament might have been a close planetary
conjunction that occurred in 6 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>  Let's see for ourselves.
Set
the Observer's location to Jerusalem, the Universal time to 16:00 UTC
February 25, &minus;5 (6 <span class="sc">B.C.</span> as historians reckon it), and
<a href="/cgi-bin/Yoursky?date=1&amp;utc=-5%2F02%2F25+16%3A00&amp;jd=2450851.02963&amp;lat=31%B046%2748%22&amp;ns=North&amp;lon=35%B013%2712%22&amp;ew=East&amp;moonp=on&amp;deepm=2.5&amp;consto=on&amp;constn=on&amp;limag=5.5&amp;starnm=1.5&amp;starbm=2.5&amp;imgsize=640&amp;scheme=0&amp;elements=">observe</a>,
shining
as a beacon in the Western sky at dusk, a rare (not to repeat for 800
years) conjunction among Jupiter (traditional king of the gods),
Saturn (ruling planet of Judah), and Mars, occurring in the
constellation of Pisces the Fish (the House of the Hebrews) where the
equinox had just entered, crossing the border from Aries where it had
been since the Greeks.  You'll recall that the early Christians
recognised one another with the sign of a fish.
</p>

<p>
A month before, in late January of 6 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>,
<a href="/cgi-bin/Yoursky?date=1&amp;utc=-5%2F01%2F25+16%3A40&amp;jd=2450851.02963&amp;lat=31%B046%2748%22&amp;ns=North&amp;lon=35%B013%2712%22&amp;ew=East&amp;moonp=on&amp;deepm=2.5&amp;consto=on&amp;constn=on&amp;limag=5.5&amp;starnm=1.5&amp;starbm=2.5&amp;imgsize=640&amp;scheme=0&amp;elements=">low
in the western skies</a> of
Jerusalem, Mars, heading for its rendezvous with Jupiter and Saturn,
passed near faint Uranus, dim yet easily seen by the naked eye in
ancient skies unpolluted by the effluvia of modern life and the light
of cities that blots out the stars.  What a wonder indeed, this new
dim wanderer in the sky, perhaps observed but never recorded.  In
Pisces, the fish.  Highly unlikely, yet intriguing nonetheless.
