<cite>Your Sky</cite> Help: Map Symbols</h1>
<hr />

<p>
<cite>Your Sky</cite>'s sky, horizon, and telescope maps show the sky as
it appears at the specified time (real or simulated) from the chosen
viewpoint.  Stars visible to the naked eye and symbols representing
the Sun, Moon (with correct phase), and planets are shown in their
correct positions in the sky.  If you've <a href="elements.html">entered
the orbital elements</a> of an asteroid
or comet to track and it's currently visible, the <a
href="icons.html">symbol representing it</a> will also appear, if
within the field of view.
</p>

<h3 id="MapOri">Map orientation</h3>

<p>
The sky map is drawn in the form normally used by astronomers.  If
you're in the Northern hemisphere, North is up and West is to the
right.  At first glance, East and West seem backwards, but remember
that a sky map represents the dome of the heavens and that you use it
(at least in your mind) by holding it over your head.  If you stand
facing North and hold the map over your head, then East and West on
the map correspond to their terrestrial directions.  Think about it.
If you're observing from the Southern hemisphere, South is up and East
is to the right.
</p>

<p>
To invert the map from the default orientation for the observing site,
check the &ldquo;<a href="controls.html#Invert">Invert North and South</a>&rdquo;
box in the Display Options section of the <a href="controls.html">sky</a>
or <a href="telcontrols.html">telescope</a> control panel.  Inverting
a horizon view would be equivalent to standing on your head, and
since few people do this while stargazing, inversion is not
provided in the <a href="horcontrols.html">horizon view</a> control panel.
</p>

<h3>Sky colour</h3>

<p>
If the default full <a href="controls.html#Scheme">colour scheme</a> is selected,
the background of the sky map and horizon views is blue if the Sun is up, dark red if
it's rising or setting, dark blue during twilight (when the Sun is
between 18 and 6 degrees below the horizon), and black at night.
Planets and stars are shown even if the Sun is up and they aren't
actually visible.  (When Venus is sufficiently elongated from the Sun
and the sky is crystal-clear, with a little effort you can see
<a href="/images/venus_daytime">Venus
with the naked eye in broad daylight</a>&mdash;the sky map tells you right
where to look!).  The virtual telescope always shows a black
background.
</p>

<h3>Celestial coordinates</h3>

<img src="images/ctlcoords.png" width="296" height="234"
     class="r" vspace="5" alt="" />
<p>
The celestial poles are marked with a light blue cross with arms
pointing at the 0, 6, 12, and 18 hour marks along the celestial
equator.  The equator is also drawn in light blue, with labeled tick
marks at every hour of right ascension.  The ecliptic is plotted in
dark red with ticks and labels every 15° of ecliptic longitude.  The
point where the ecliptic intersects the celestial equator at 0 hours
of right ascension and 0° ecliptic longitude is called the &ldquo;March
Equinox&rdquo; or &ldquo;First Point of Aries&rdquo; (even though the equinox hasn't
actually occurred at that point in the constellation of Aries for more
than 2000 years&mdash;it's in Pisces now, and will pass into Aquarius in
the year 2597 when the &ldquo;Age of Aquarius&rdquo; actually dawns some six
hundred years after the rather premature but nonetheless catchy
popular song which heralded it).  You can turn the coordinate display on
and off with the &ldquo;<a href="controls.html#Coords">Ecliptic and equator</a>&rdquo;
check box in the Display Options control panel.

</p>

<h3>Constellations</h3>

<img src="images/ctlconst.png" width="173" height="179"
     class="r" vspace="5" alt="" />
<p>
To aid in orienting yourself, the names and outlines of the
constellations and the borders between the constellations are normally
shown in all maps.  You can toggle these annotations on and off
with the corresponding check boxes in the
&ldquo;<a href="controls.html#Constellations">Constellations</a>&rdquo; section of
the Display Options panel.  In sky maps, constellation names can be
drawn either horizontally or aligned with the nearest horizon.  The
&ldquo;aligned with horizon?&rdquo; check box controls whether this alignment is
done.  Printed star maps often align constellation names in this way,
but you may find aligned names more difficult to read on a computer
monitor.
<br clear="right" />
</p>

<h3>Star names and designations</h3>

<img src="images/ctlstars.png" width="242" height="218"
     class="r" vspace="5" alt="" />
<p>
Names of bright stars such as Vega, Capella, and Altair are normally
shown on the sky map; you can toggle star names on and off with the
<a href="controls.html#StarName">Star names</a> box in the control panel.
Less prominent stars are identified by
the Greek (&ldquo;Bayer&rdquo;) letter or Flamsteed number within the
constellation; you can turn this nomenclature on and off with the
<a href="controls.html#StarBFlam">Bayer/Flamsteed</a> codes box.
<br clear="right" />
</p>

<h3>Solar system objects</h3>

<img src="images/ctlplanet.png" width="163" height="127"
     class="r" vspace="5" alt="" />
<p>
Solar system objects, including the Sun, Moon (in its correct phase),
planets, and any asteroid or comet for which you've
<a href="elements.html">entered orbital elements</a> are shown in the sky
map as <a href="icons.html#Planets">symbols</a> at the correct
positions in the sky.  You can switch display of solar system objects
on and off with the
&ldquo;<a href="controls.html#Planets">Moon and planets</a>&rdquo; check box.
</p>

<p>
The technique used to calculate the positions of the planets
from Mercury through Neptune is
valid only for dates less than
<span class="sc">A.D. 8000</span>; if you specify a date further in
the future, the Moon and planets are not plotted on the map and no
<a href="ephemeris.html">ephemeris</a> is shown.  Pluto has been
observed over an insufficient fraction of its orbit to allow
accurate computation of its position outside the range of
years from 1885 through 2099; Pluto is not plotted for dates
outside this interval.

</p>

<h3>Deep sky objects</h3>

<img src="images/ctldeep.png" width="281" height="220"
     class="r" vspace="5" alt="" />
<p>
Nonstellar objects from a deep sky database are plotted as
<a href="icons.html#DeepSky">labeled icons</a> in the sky map;
you can hide or display them with the
&ldquo;<a href="controls.html#DeepSky">Deep sky objects</a>&rdquo; check box.  Only
objects brighter than the magnitude specified in the accompanying
input field will be shown.
