<p>
This document contains all the controls in the <cite>Your Sky</cite>
Virtual Telescope control panel, with an explanation of the
function of each.  The controls in this document are &ldquo;live&rdquo;&mdash;you're
free to experiment with various settings, pressing the &ldquo;Update&rdquo; button
at the top or bottom of the page to display a telescope display with
the settings you've chosen.
</p>

<form method="post" name="request" action="/cgi-bin/Yourtel">

<center>
<input type="submit" value="Update" class="s" />

<h3><a name="DateTime" class="i">Date and Time</a></h3>

<p>
Three options are available for specifying the date and time.
Choose an option by checking the box to the left and
(for options other than &ldquo;Now&rdquo;) enter the date in the
corresponding format in the text box to the right.
</p>

<blockquote>
<label><input type="radio" class="i" name="date" onclick="0" checked="checked" value="0" /> <a name="Now" class="i">Now</a></label>

<p>
    &ldquo;Now&rdquo; displays a star map for the
    <a href="#AimPoint">Aim Point</a> specified below at
    the current moment.
</p>
</blockquote>

<label><input type="radio" name="date" onclick="0" value="1" /> <a name="UTC" class="i">Universal time:</a></label>
<input type="text" name="utc" onchange="document.request.date[1].checked=true;"
       value="1775/4/19 05:00:00" size="20" />
<blockquote>
<p>
  This option permits you to enter any Universal (also known as Greenwich Mean)
  date and time in the format
  <em>year</em>/<em>month</em>/<em>day</em>&nbsp;<em>hour</em>/<em>minute</em>/<em>second</em>.
  You can omit the minutes and seconds of the time, or omit the
  time entirely if you wish to specify 00:00 UTC.
</p>

<p>
  You can enter dates as far back as Julian day 0, January 1, &minus;4712
  and as far into the future as you wish.  Note that astronomers and
  historians use different conventions for years before <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1.  In
  history books, the year that preceded <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1 is called 1 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>, zero
  not having come into use in European culture at the time.
  Astronomers denote the year before <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1 as &ldquo;year 0&rdquo;.  Thus when
  an astronomer talks about an eclipse having occurred in the year
  &minus;412, that's the year historians refer to as &ldquo;413 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>&rdquo;.  In
  converting historical dates to Julian days, <cite>Your Sky</cite> assumes the
  canonical date for the adoption of the Gregorian calendar, Friday,
  October 15th, 1582.  Many countries shifted to the Gregorian
  calendar much later; in Great Britain, not until 1752.  When
  investigating events in history, make sure you express all dates
  after October 15th, 1582 in the Gregorian calendar.

<blockquote>
<p>
    Astronomers often have to do arithmetic with dates and times.  The
    Gregorian calendar is sufficiently eccentric that answering a
    question like &ldquo;What is the date and time 295.03589 days (10 lunar
    months) from now?&rdquo; is a nontrivial exercise.  To facilitate
    computation, astronomers employ the <em>Julian day</em> calendar.
    The Julian day number for a given moment in time is simply the
    number of days, whole and fractional, elapsed since noon (12:00)
    Universal time on 1st January &minus;4712; time is expressed as a
    fraction of a day.  This system allows assigning a positive number
    to the date and time of any observation in recorded history and
    arbitrarily far into the future, and permits ordinary arithmetic
    with dates and times without having to worry about <span class="sc">B.C.</span> and <span class="sc">A.D.</span>,
    Julian and Gregorian calendars, leap years, and all that.  Of
    course, you need to be able to convert back and forth between
    Julian days and the civil calendar, but that's what computers are
    for.
</p>

<p>
    To show a star map for a given Julian day, simply check the box
    and enter the Julian day number in the box to the right, including
    a fraction where appropriate.  (Be sure to remember that Julian
    days begin at noon&mdash;a Julian date representing midnight will end
    in &ldquo;.5&rdquo;.) Click &ldquo;Update&rdquo; to show the map for the designated aim
    point at that day.

          <h3><a name="AimPoint" class="i">Aim Point</a></h3>

<p>
The Aim Point fields specify the celestial coordinates at which the
virtual telescope is aimed; that point will appear at the centre of
the telescope display.  The scale of the display is set by the field
of view, the inverse of magnification in a telescope.  Objects in the
sky are assigned coordinates in a system based on the Earth's
equatorial plane.  <em>Declination</em> is the celestial latitude of
an object, and ranges from +90 for the point in the sky above the
Earth's north pole to &minus;90 for the corresponding point above the south
pole.  <em>Right Ascension</em> is the celestial equivalent of
longitude.  Like terrestrial longitudes, which are measured from an
arbitrary point (the Greenwich meridian), right ascensions are, by
convention, measured from one of the two points at which the ecliptic
(plane in which the Earth orbits the Sun) intersects the equatorial
plane.  Due to the effects of <a href="precession.html">precession</a>
this point moves slowly over the years, completing a full circle every
25,800 years; it is presently located in the constellation of <a
href="/cgi-bin/Yourtel?lat=0&amp;lon=0&amp;z=1">Pisces</a>.  While
declination is, like latitude, given in degrees, right ascensions have
traditionally been specified by <em>hour angle</em>, in which the
equator is divided into twenty-four 15° segments.  Hour angles reduce
the amount of calculation needed to determine the position of an
object in the sky at a specific location on the Earth.  Now that
computers have largely eliminated the need to calculate positions by
hand, professional astronomers increasingly specify right ascensions
in degrees instead of hour angles; the virtual telescope accepts
either form of specification.
</p>
<blockquote>
<label><a name="RightAscension" class="i">Right Ascension</a>:
<input type="text" name="lon" value="3h 30m" size="15" /></label>
</blockquote>

<p>
To point the telescope in a specific direction (using the &ldquo;setting
circles&rdquo;, as it were), enter a right ascension and declination in the
Aim Point boxes.  You can enter right ascension in degrees; hours
and fractional hours; or hours, minutes, and seconds.  The following
are all equivalent when entered in the Right ascension box:
</p>

<pre>
        3h 30m
        3.5h
        52.5
</pre>

<blockquote>

<label><input type="radio" name="ns" checked="checked" value="North" /> North</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="ns" value="South" /> South</label>
</blockquote>

<p>
Declination may be entered as degrees and a decimal fraction;
degrees and minutes with a decimal fraction; or degrees, minutes, and
seconds.  The following Declination settings are equivalent:
</p>

<pre>
        45d 15m
        45° 15'
        45D 15' 0.00"
        45.25
</pre>

<blockquote>
<label><a name="FieldOfView" class="i">Field of view</a>:
<input type="text" name="fov" value="45°" size="10" /></label>
</blockquote>

<p>
The field of view gives the scale of the image&mdash;it will span
the given number of degrees in declination and right
ascension.  The default of 45° gives a large-scale view
on the scale of a constellation.  By comparison,
binoculars have fields of view on the order of 8 degrees,
rich field telescopes about 3 degrees, and typical
amateur telescopes about 1 degree.  Reducing
the field of view is equivalent to increasing the
magnification of a telescope.  Field of view is limited
to 60°&mdash;beyond that, distortion of the image
becomes unacceptable in a telescope-like map
projection; for an all-sky map, visit the
<cite>Your Sky</cite> <a href="../#Skymap">Sky Map</a> page.

<a name="FindObject" href="../catalogues/catalogues.html"><b>Find object in catalogue</b></a>

<p>
You can point the virtual telescope at a specific object in the sky by
clicking its name in one of the <a href="../catalogues/catalogues.html">object
catalogues</a> which accompany <cite>Your Sky</cite>; the selected object
will be centred in the virtual telescope display and its coordinates
will appear in the aim point boxes.

    This box controls whether the celestial coordinate system appears
    in the map.  When checked, the pole is marked with a small light
    blue cross with arms pointing toward the 0, 6, 12, and 18 hour
    marks on the equator, the celestial equator is drawn in light
    blue, labeled at each hour of right ascension, and the ecliptic is
    drawn in red with labels every 15° of ecliptical longitude.
</p>

<p>
    The celestial poles are the points in the sky at the zenith
    above the Earth's poles; the celestial equator is the projection
    of the Earth's equator onto the sky, and the ecliptic is the
    plane in which the Earth orbits the Sun.  The obliquity of
    the ecliptic changes slowly through time as the Earth's
    inclination varies, and the points at which the ecliptic crosses the equator
    (the equinoxes) also shift over time due to
    <a href="precession.html">precession</a>.

    The Moon icon will show the Moon with the correct phase, with

</p>

<p>
    The technique used to calculate the positions of the planets
    from Mercury through Neptune is
    valid only for dates less than <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 8000; if you specify a date further into
    the future, the Moon and planets are not plotted on the map and no
    <a href="ephemeris.html">ephemeris</a> is shown.  Pluto has been
    observed over an insufficient arc of its orbit to allow
    accurate computation of its position outside the range of
    years from 1885 through 2099; Pluto is not plotted for dates
    outside this interval.

<blockquote>
<p>
    The human visual system, inherited from hundreds of millions of
    years of mammalian evolution, excels in finding patterns.  Spotting
    the fearful symmetry of a tiger lurking in the bush quickly enough
    to run away means you're likely to have more children than
    folks who lack that talent, so we've all inherited the genes of those
    with the high-end pattern matching meatware.  As a result,
    we see patterns <em>everywhere</em>, even where no pattern
    is really there.  What child, or adult on a lazy day, hasn't
    gazed at the clouds boiling up on a hot summer afternoon
    and seen, in the sky, the fantasy images which inhabit our
    dreams?
</p>
<p>
    We see patterns in the night sky as well.  Every civilisation
    has grouped the stars into constellations representing
    key aspects of their culture.  The constellations in the
    northern hemisphere sky recognised by Western cultures
    are largely inherited from classical Greece&mdash;they are the
    goddesses and gods of Olympus and the heroes of Greek
    mythology.
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/ctlconst.png" width="173" height="179" class="r" vspace="5" alt="" />
    Constellations in the southern hemisphere were named innumerable
    times by the multitude of cultures who observed them since
    antiquity.  European culture was, however, unaware of most
    of the southern sky prior to the Enlightenment and the
    ensuing age of exploration, so many southern constellations were named for
    contemporary wonders such as the microscope (<em>Microscopium</em>),
    air pump (<em>Antila</em>), and clock (<em>Horologium</em>).
</p>

<p>
    Perhaps if our cultural baggage had been lost at the
    generation-port, we'd look at the stars and see in
    them the Five Original Marx Brothers, Lucy in the Sky,
    and Bart's Skateboard.  <cite>Your Sky</cite> serves up the traditional
    constellations, offering the following options.

<p>
    If checked, the boundaries between adjacent constellations are drawn
    in green.
</p>

<p>
    The constellation boundaries we use today were adopted in 1930 by
    the <a href="http://www.intastun.org/">International Astronomical Union</a>,
    based on a partial set of
    boundaries compiled in 1877 by B. A. Gould.  Gould's original boundaries
<!-- Gould, B.A., 1877, Uranometria Argentina, mapas (Buenos Aires, Argentina: Observatorio Nacional) -->
    star maps but, for simplicity, ran purely east-west and
    north-south in the celestial sphere.  But as the Earth's axis
    <a href="precession.html">precesses</a>
    with regard to the distant stars, completing a full
    circle every 25,800 years, equatorial coordinates change with
    regard to the fixed stars, so the original boundaries, defined
    in 1877, no longer run parallel to lines of
    longitude and latitude today.  (Precession may seem like
    a minor effect, significant only in the very long term, but it can
    creep up on you.  In the century and a quarter since 1877,
    precession has moved Polaris three quarters of a degree closer to
    the north celestial pole&mdash;that's one and a half
    <a href="/earthview/moon_ap_per.html">diameters of the full Moon</a>!)
</p>

<p>
    Consequently, it's necessary to adjust the constellation
    boundaries to account for precession.  The boundaries used by
    <cite>Your Sky</cite> have been precessed in a simple fashion to the
    J2000.0 epoch.  Approximating the precise 1875 boundaries based on
    the best available published data would require plotting more than
    13,000 vectors and didn't seem worth it, especially since you
    could hardly see the difference on an all-sky map.

    The following controls permit choosing how many stars

    field.  The brightness of a star is given by its
    <em>magnitude</em>, with a larger numerical magnitude indicating
    a dimmer star.  The brightest star (excluding the Sun) is
    Sirius, with a magnitude of &minus;1.46.  There are about 20 stars
    brighter (having a magnitude less than) 1.5, and about 100
    stars brighter than magnitude 2.6.  The number of stars increases
    rapidly with the magnitude&mdash;there are about a thousand stars

    The default full colour scheme is easiest to view on computer

    This is the traditional choice for printed star atlases.
    If you're planning to print the chart on a black and white

    Many astronomers find charts with white stars and text on a

    they use at the telescope to preserve night vision.  The virtual telescope
    will produce charts in this form, but if you're planning
    to print the resulting charts, ponder the
    consequences for your printer.  All of that black has to come
    from somewhere, and that somewhere is generally your printer's
    ink or toner cartridge.  Making lots of white on black maps
    can use up cartridges at a prodigious rate compared to
    printing normal text.  Also, mostly black documents
    cause problems with some printers; laser printers may
    print a &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; on subsequent pages due to excess toner
    adhering to the imaging surface, and inkjet printers sometimes
    splatter ink around when feeding the large amount needed for
    extended regions of black.  Your printer may be immune from
    these foibles, but if it isn't, don't say I didn't warn you.

    If you're taking your laptop computer into the field to use
    at the telescope, this option may be just the ticket.  All
    items on the map are displayed in red, which doesn't tend
    to degrade night vision.  When using this option, use the
    display brightness control to reduce the intensity to the
    minimum level at which you can still easily read the map.
    Where possible, other material in the map document is
    displayed red on black, like this paragraph.

    <h3><a name="Tracking" class="i">Asteroid</a> and Comet Tracking</h3>
<p>
    Given the orbital elements for an asteroid (minor planet) or
    comet, <cite>Your Sky</cite>'s virtual telescope can calculate the
    position of that object in the sky for any time within the epoch
    of validity of the elements and display it in the correct location
    in the sky.  Specifying orbital elements is an advanced topic
    which is discussed in detail in a separate
    <a href="elements.html"><cite>Asteroid and Comet Tracking</cite></a>
    document.
